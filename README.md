Predicts sport event results

In the data analysis field, data scientists still have a lot of troubles figuring out useful different algorithms for specific problems. Predicting sports events results can be very challenging, since the information of a sport match can include so many factors. For example, injury of the athletes, home or away, coach, fatigue, and opponent can all be important influential factors effecting a team to win or lose. Furthermore, those factors we mentioned above are very difficult to converge into numerical dataset in a meaningful way.
The idea of our project is to use brain of human beings, mainly funs, as the analysis tool to do the analysis for us. Fans of a certain team like to post their thought about their supporting team before the match. If we could catch the posts and do sentiment analysis on it, we then can figure out if the fans as a whole is positive or negative about the upcoming match. In our project, we will use social media, Twitter, as the source of our sentiment analysis.
